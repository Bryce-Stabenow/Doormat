# Doormat

A quick, easy, hompage you can customize yourself!

ATTENTION: Github pages is currently not working. Trying to fix this soon!

## Tools and Development

This site was built using React with custom css and images. I wanted a site that users can access to easily set button links to different sites. This way, you can have a better version of the "new tab" information sent by chrome. Seeing as I only visit about 10 websites daily, I set a neat cap of 25 to the site.

## Future TODOs

There are still some more features I will be adding in the future:

- Converting exisiting state to read from either localStorage or a login utilizing MongoDB or Firebase. As of 5/16, this app has no back-end (but it does on my personal branch).
- Addition of a "Quote of the Day" somewhere on the page.
- Mobile-friendly layout utilizing CSS (this is next after the database addition)
- More feature on the squares and frame like adjusting color, background images, etc. to personalize.
